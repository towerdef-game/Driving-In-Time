<h1>25. Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>This chapter lists a number of common stumbling blocks that can be encountered while working with FMOD Studio, along with techniques for overcoming them.</p>
<p>If you encounter a problem, and none of the techniques listed in this chapter help, post a question on the <a href="https://qa.fmod.com/">FMOD Forums</a> for advice and support.</p>
<h2 id="the-project-can-be-auditioned-in-fmod-studio-but-the-game-is-silent"><a href="#the-project-can-be-auditioned-in-fmod-studio-but-the-game-is-silent">25.1 The project can be auditioned in FMOD Studio, but the game is silent</a></h2>
<p><strong>Make sure that all your events are assigned to banks.</strong> <a href="glossary.html#event">Events</a> must be assigned to <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a> in order for them to be included in those banks when they are <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#building">built</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p><strong>Try rebuilding your banks and using the rebuilt banks in your game.</strong> Rebuilding your banks ensures that they include the most up-to-date version of your project's content.</p>
<p><strong>After rebuilding your banks, check for error messages and warnings in the logging tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#console-window">console window</span class="dead-link">.</strong> Messages in the logging tab may describe specific issues or problems that arose while building, and addressing these issues may resolve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Check whether any <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshots</a> that reduce the volumes of your project's <a href="glossary.html#bus">buses</a> are active.</strong> If a snapshot that silences a bus is active when it should not be, removing the unwanted instances of that snapshot should result in that bus' events becoming audible again. You can audition the effects of a snapshot in the <a href="glossary.html#mixer-window">mixer window</a> by selecting the snapshot in the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#snapshots-browser">snapshots browser</span class="dead-link"> and pressing the play button in the <a href="glossary.html#transport-controls">transport controls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check that your game's code is correctly creating and starting <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">instances</a> of your project's events.</strong> For information about playing events in the FMOD Engine, see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-guide.html#playing-events">Playing Events</a> section of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-guide.html">Studio API Guide</a> chapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2">FMOD API User Guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check that the FMOD Studio system is being initialized correctly by your game's code.</strong> Failing to initialize the FMOD Studio system correctly can result in a complete failure of all audio in your game. For more information about initializing the FMOD Studio system, see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=white-papers-getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> white paper in the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2">FMOD API User Guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check that the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=core-api-system.html#fmod_outputtype"><code>FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE</code></a> specified in your game's code is correct for producing audible output on the platform on which your game is being run.</strong> If you are using an ASIO output device, check that the driver is not being taken by another application, and ensure that a fallback option is available.</p>
<h2 id="some-events-arent-audible-at-runtime"><a href="#some-events-arent-audible-at-runtime">25.2 Some events aren't audible at runtime</a></h2>
<p><strong>Check whether the affected events are subject to distance-based attenuation.</strong> An event may be subject to distance-based attenuation if it includes at least one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="glossary.html#spatializer-effect">spatializer</a> effect, object spatializer effect, or other effect that provides spatialization. An event subject to spatialization is inaudible when the distance between the <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">emitter</a> and <a href="glossary.html#listener">listener</a> is greater than or equal to the spatializing effect's max distance property.</li>
<li>A <a href="working-with-instruments.html#scatterer-instruments">scatterer instrument</a> automatically applies spatialization to all the <a href="working-with-instruments.html#single-instruments">single instruments</a> in its <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlist</a>. This spatialization has a max distance of 20 units, and so may cause the instrument to be inaudible at greater distances from the listener.</li>
<li>A <a href="parameters-reference.html#distance">distance built-in parameter</a> that automates a volume property. Depending on the automation curves used, <a href="authoring-events.html#automation">automation</a> of a volume property can potentially reduce volume to the point of inaudibility at any point along the automating parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Events with distance attenuation may also be silent at other distances if they are subject to multiple forms of distance attenuation.</p>
<p><strong>Check the affected events' stealing behavior.</strong> An event whose <a href="event-macro-controls-reference.html#max-instances">max instances</a> property is less than &#8734; may have its <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">instances</a> stolen according to its <a href="event-macro-controls-reference.html#stealing">stealing</a> property, preventing those instances from playing. Events with the oldest, quietest, virtualize, or furthest stealing behaviors may end suddenly when new instances of those events are started, and events with the furthest or none stealing behaviors may not start if too many instances of the event are already playing.</p>
<p><strong>Check the stealing behavior of the group buses into which the affected events are routed.</strong> An event routed into a group bus whose max instances property is less than &#8734; may have its instances stolen according to the group bus' stealing property, preventing those instances from playing. Group buses with the oldest, quietest, or furthest stealing behaviors may cause event instances to stop when new instances of those events are started, and group buses with the furthest or none stealing behaviors may prevent new event instances from starting if too many playing event instances are routed into the bus.</p>
<p>If you want to stop an event's instances from being stolen due to bus instance limiting, try increasing the bus' max instances property, or routing fewer events into that bus. Alternatively, setting the event's priority to Highest prevents its instances from being stolen, but may cause other events' instances to be stolen instead.</p>
<p><strong>If the affected events contain programmer instruments, make sure that your game's code is correctly receiving and handling the generated callback.</strong> For information on programmer instrument callbacks, see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-api-eventinstance.html#fmod_studio_programmer_sound_properties"><code>FMOD_STUDIO_PROGRAMMER_SOUND_PROPERTIES</code></a> section of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-api-eventinstance.html">Studio API Reference</a> chapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2">FMOD API User Manual</a>.</p>
<h2 id="events-occasionally-stop-part-way-through-during-runtime"><a href="#events-occasionally-stop-part-way-through-during-runtime">25.3 Events occasionally stop part-way through during runtime</a></h2>
<p><strong>Check whether the affected <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> have content that might be causing them to stop automatically.</strong> A non-persistent event stops automatically if it is not currently producing any output and there is no further content on its <a href="glossary.html#timeline">timeline</a>. If the affected events are stopping automatically when you would prefer they wouldn't, change their content so that they stop under different circumstances. For more information on when events stop naturally, see the <a href="authoring-events.html#auditioning-events">Auditioning Events</a> section of the <a href="authoring-events.html">Authoring Events</a> chapter. If you prefer that an affected event does not automatically stop under any circumstances, try making it <a href="glossary.html#persistent">persistent</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Check the affected events' stealing behavior.</strong> An event whose <a href="event-macro-controls-reference.html#max-instances">max instances</a> property is less than &#8734; may have its <a href="glossary.html#event-instance">instances</a> stolen according to its <a href="event-macro-controls-reference.html#stealing">stealing</a> property, potentially stopping the stolen instances from playing to completion. Events with the oldest, quietest, virtualize, or furthest stealing behaviors may end suddenly when new instances of those events are started.</p>
<p><strong>Check the stealing behavior of the group buses into which the affected events are routed.</strong> An event routed into a group bus whose max instances property is less than &#8734; may have its instances stolen according to the group bus' stealing property, stopping the stolen instances from playing to completion. Group buses with the oldest, quietest, or furthest stealing behaviors may cause event instances to stop when new event instances are routed into that bus.</p>
<p><strong>Search your project for <a href="glossary.html#command-instrument">command instruments</a> that might stop the affected events.</strong> You can search for <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instruments</a> that reference an event by right-clicking on that event in the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a> and selecting "Find References &gt; In Events" from the <a href="glossary.html#context-menu">context menu</a>. If a command instrument is stopping an event when it should not be, adjust its position and trigger conditions to ensure it only stops the target event at appropriate times.</p>
<p><strong>Check whether your game's code is stopping the affected events.</strong> If your game's code is designed to stop certain events, make sure it is doing so in the correct circumstances. For information about stopping events in code, see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-api-eventinstance.html#studio_eventinstance_stop">Studio::EventInstance::stop</a> section of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-api-eventinstance.html">Studio::EventInstance</a> subchapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-api.html">Studio API Reference</a> chapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2">FMOD API User Manual</a>. You can see whether and when a <code>Studio::EventInstance::stop()</code> command is being called by recording a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#profiler-session">profiler session</span class="dead-link"> using <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#live-update">live update</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<h2 id="events-are-too-deterministic-during-runtime"><a href="#events-are-too-deterministic-during-runtime">25.4 Events are too deterministic during runtime</a></h2>
<p><strong>Make sure your game's code is setting the FMOD Engine's random seed.</strong> If your code does not set a seed for the FMOD Engine's random number generation, the FMOD engine will default to a seed of 0 when the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=studio-guide.html#creating-the-studio-system"><code>Studio::System</code> is initialized</a>. Using the same seed each time causes the same random numbers to be generated each of those times, which can be useful for debugging, but may be undesirable for some games. For information on setting random seeds, see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=core-api-system.html#fmod_advancedsettings"><code>FMOD_ADVANCEDSETTINGS</code></a> and <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=core-api-system.html#system_setadvancedsettings"><code>System::setAdvancedSettings</code></a> sections of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=core-api-system.html">System</a> subchapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=core-api.html">Core API Reference</a> chapter of the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2">FMOD API User Manual</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If your game's code is setting the FMOD Engine's random seed, make sure it is setting a different seed each time the game is run.</strong> Using the same seed each time you initialize the <code>Studio::System</code> results in identical behavior each time. A popular method of guaranteeing a different seed is to use the current time.</p>
<h2 id="music-tracks-are-getting-out-of-sync"><a href="#music-tracks-are-getting-out-of-sync">25.5 Music tracks are getting out of sync</a></h2>
<p><strong>Ensure the music <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">assets</a> are not set to <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#streaming-loading-mode">stream</span class="dead-link">.</strong> Streaming sounds depend on loading, playing, and unloading audio files a chunk at a time, meaning that streaming audio cannot scheduled for a precise moment. In addition, most platforms can only support a very small number of simultaneous <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#stream">streams</span class="dead-link">, and produce choppy output if that number is exceeded. Switching an affected asset to not stream causes the entire asset to be loaded into memory, but improves the precision with which it can be scheduled.</p>
<p><strong>Try setting the priority macro control of the affected event to Highest.</strong> The FMOD Engine's low-level voice limiting system automatically culls inaudible voices in order to keep resource consumption low, then restores those voices when they become audible. If a voice from a music event is restored in this fashion, it may start again from the beginning and be out of sync with other playing music. Setting an event's priority to Highest prevents its voices from being culled, even when they are inaudible.</p>
<h2 id="ahdsr-modulators-arent-playing-out-their-releases"><a href="#ahdsr-modulators-arent-playing-out-their-releases">25.6 AHDSR modulators aren't playing out their releases.</a></h2>
<p><strong>Make sure the modulator isn't on a synchronous instrument.</strong> Synchronous instruments produce no output when not overlapped by the playback position, and so do not play their release periods when no longer overlapped. This means that if a synchronous instrument is untriggered because it is no longer overlapped by the playback position, it stops producing audio immediately, even if it has an AHDSR modulator.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure the modulator isn't on a property of an instrument inside an instrument's playlist.</strong> Untriggering an instrument does not untrigger the individual instruments in that instrument's playlist, so untriggering an instrument does not cause AHDSR modulators on playlist entry properties to play out their releases.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure the <a href="glossary.html#modulator">modulator</a> is on a property that will cause it to enter its release at the correct time.</strong> Each <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a> is tied to a specific <a href="glossary.html#event">event</a>, <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a>, or <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshot</a>, and its behavior is based on the state of that event, instrument, or snapshot.</p>
<p>The release periods of AHDSR modulators on instruments (including <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#event-instrument">event instruments</span class="dead-link"> and <a href="glossary.html#snapshot-instrument">snapshot instruments</a>) begin when their associated instruments are untriggered. This means that the release period of an AHDSR modulator on an instrument does <em>not</em> start when the parent event is stopped, but when the instrument is untriggered. It also means that an AHDSR modulator on an instrument can only play out its full release period if the parent continues playing until the release period ends. This behavior allows an event to have complex stopping behavior, instead of always immediately stopping all the instruments in the event.</p>
<p>The release periods of AHDSR modulators on event or snapshot properties, such as macros, <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">tracks</a>, <a href="glossary.html#effect">effects</a>, and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#local-parameter">local parameter</span class="dead-link"> values, begin when the event or snapshot is stopped. This means that the release period of an AHDSR modulator on a snapshot or event begins when the snapshot or event is stopped, regardless of whether it is stopped by your game's code or by a snapshot or event instrument being untriggered.</p>
<p><strong>If you want the AHDSR modulator to affect a snapshot instrument, ensure that the modulator is on an intensity property rather than a volume property.</strong> An AHDSR modulator on a track's volume affects only the volume of the signal routed through that track. Snapshot instruments do not produce any output that is mixed into the track's signal, and so are not indirectly affected by modulators on the track's volume as other instruments are.</p>
<h2 id="snapshots-arent-releasing-gradually-when-stopped"><a href="#snapshots-arent-releasing-gradually-when-stopped">25.7 Snapshots aren't releasing gradually when stopped.</a></h2>
<p><strong>If the <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshot</a> is triggered as an <a href="glossary.html#event">event</a>, make sure the snapshot's intensity <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#macro">macro</span class="dead-link"> has an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a>.</strong> Modulators on the intensity property of a <a href="glossary.html#snapshot-instrument">snapshot instrument</a> only affect <a href="glossary.html#snapshot-instance">instances</a> of the snapshot triggered by that snapshot instrument. If you want a snapshot triggered as an event to play out the release period of an AHDSR modulator, that modulator must be on the intensity macro of the snapshot, rather than on the intensity <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#instrument-property">property</span class="dead-link"> of a snapshot instrument elsewhere in the project.</p>
<p><strong>If the snapshot is triggered by a snapshot instrument, make sure that the instrument is <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#trigger-behavior">untriggered</span class="dead-link"> when you want the release to occur.</strong> Stopping an event does not automatically untrigger any of the instruments in that event. This means that an AHDSR modulator on a snapshot instrument does not automatically enter its release period when the event containing the instrument is stopped.</p>
<p>If you want an <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> to stop when the event containing it is stopped, one option is to add a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#parameter-trigger-condition">parameter trigger condition</span class="dead-link"> to the instrument, put an AHDSR modulator on the value of the <a href="glossary.html#parameter">parameter</a>, and set the properties of the modulator and trigger condition such that stopping the event causes the parameter to change value and untrigger the instrument.</p>
<p><strong>If the snapshot is triggered by a snapshot instrument, make sure the event continues playing until the release period of the snapshot instrument's AHDSR modulator has finished.</strong> When an event finally stops, any instrument in that event stops immediately. Designing an event so that it finally stops only after an instrument's release period finishes ensures that that instrument's release period always has time to finish.</p>
<p>If you want an event to not stop immediately when given a stop command, the easiest option is to add an AHDSR modulator to one of the <a href="glossary.html#event-property">event's properties</a>. An AHDSR modulator on an event property causes the event to take time to stop even if the modulator does not meaningfully affect the output or behavior of the event. When multiple properties of an event have AHDSR modulators, the modulator with the longest release time determines when the event ends.</p>
<h2 id="fmod-studio-crashes-on-launch"><a href="#fmod-studio-crashes-on-launch">25.8 FMOD Studio crashes on launch.</a></h2>
<p><strong>When prompted, choose to restart FMOD Studio in safe mode.</strong> In some circumstances, a bad or corrupt <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#plug-in">plug-in</span class="dead-link"> may cause FMOD Studio to crash. <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#safe-mode">Safe mode</span class="dead-link"> prevents most plug-ins from being automatically loaded.</p>
<p><strong>Empty or rename your plug-ins folders.</strong> In some circumstances, safe mode does not prevent all plug-ins from loading. If crashes persist even in safe mode, renaming or deleting your plug-ins folders should prevent the plug-ins in those folders from being found and loaded.</p>
<p>Plug-ins can be found in the following locations:</p>

<h2 id="fmod-studio-crashes-at-other-times"><a href="#fmod-studio-crashes-at-other-times">25.9 FMOD Studio crashes at other times.</a></h2>
<p><strong>If you are using macOS and running an accessibility application, try disabling that accessibility software.</strong> Certain accessibility applications (such as Karabiner, Teleportd, and DisableMonitor) can interfere with FMOD Studio, causing crashes. Disabling the software may prevent the crash from occurring.</p>
<p><strong>If you are using MacOS X version 10.14, open your zoom options and ensure the "Use keyboard shortcut to zoom" and "Continuously with pointer" settings are unchecked.</strong> These settings are known to interfere with FMOD Studio in some cases, causing crashes. Switching to "Only when the pointer reaches an edge" instead may fix the problem.</p>
