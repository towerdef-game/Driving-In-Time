<h1>6. Managing Assets</h1>
<p>Managing a project's audio assets is an important part of using the FMOD Studio suite efficiently.</p>
<p>You can import, manage, organize, and audition audio files in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>. The assets browser also allows you to add files you've imported to events and instruments, and to specify how they'll be encoded into banks.</p>
<p>In addition to importing audio files that you already own, you can buy a variety of audio files from our online store, FMOD.io.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>The assets browser represents the actual files and folders in your project's "Assets" directory. Any change to the items displayed in the assets browser represents a change to those files and folders, and <em>cannot</em> be undone via the "Edit &gt; Undo" menu item.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-the-assets-browser"><a href="#anatomy-of-the-assets-browser">6.1 Anatomy of the Assets Browser</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a> displays the <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio files</a> and folders in your project's assets directory. It allows you to audition, edit, and organize your project's audio files, as well as to add those files to <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instruments</a> and <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a>. It can be found in the <a href="glossary.html#event-editor-window">event editor</a> and the <a href="glossary.html#audio-bin-window">audio bin</a> windows.</p>
<p><img alt="assets browser" src="images/assetsBrowser.png" /></p>
<p>At the top of the assets browser is the assets browser <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#search-bar">search bar</span class="dead-link">. Below it are all the files and folders in your project's "Assets" subdirectory. You can drag files from your <a href="glossary.html#file-manager">file manager</a> onto the assets browser in order to import them into your project. You can drag files from the assets browser onto instruments, <a href="glossary.html#track">tracks</a>, <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlists</a>, and the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a> to use them in your project.</p>
<p>When an asset or folder is selected, its <a href="#compression-and-platform-encoding">custom encoding settings</a> and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset-preview">asset preview</span class="dead-link"> (if any) are displayed at the bottom of the assets browser. </p>
<p><img alt="Custom Encoding Settings" src="images/customEncodingSettings.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to setting the encoding format for the current platform, you can set an asset's loading mode. For more information about loading modes and compression, see the <a href="managing-assets.html#compression-and-platform-encoding">Compression and Platform Encoding</a> section of this chapter.</p>
<p><img alt="Asset Preview" src="images/assetPreview.png" /></p>
<p>The asset preview allows you to view the waveform of an asset, and to <a href="glossary.html#audition">audition</a> it both with and without compression.</p>
<h2 id="folders-and-files"><a href="#folders-and-files">6.2 Folders and Files</a></h2>
<p>All the <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio files</a> and folders in your project's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#assets-folder">assets folder</span class="dead-link"> are displayed in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>. This browser is your main tool for importing and organizing your project's audio files, and for adding them to <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instruments</a> and <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that making changes in the assets browser makes changes to the contents of project directory on disk. If you create, delete, or move files or folders in the assets browser in FMOD Studio, the corresponding files and folders in the assets folder on disk are also created, deleted, or moved.</p>
<h3 id="importing-audio-files"><a href="#importing-audio-files">6.2.1 Importing Audio Files</a></h3>
<p>To <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#import">import</span class="dead-link"> a file into an FMOD Studio project, drag it from a <a href="glossary.html#file-manager">file manager</a> window onto the assets browser. This copies the file into the project's "Assets" folder. If you drag the file onto a particular folder in the assets browser, it is added to that folder.</p>
<p>You can also import files by selecting "File &gt; Import Assets..." and selecting the files you want to import in the dialog. Files imported in this way are copied into your project's assets folder.</p>
<p>While any kind of file can be imported into FMOD Studio, only audio files can be auditioned and used in events. Specifically, FMOD Studio can load and play files with the file name extensions <code>.wav</code>, <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.ogg</code>, <code>.aif</code>, <code>.aiff</code>, <code>.wma</code>, and <code>.flac</code>.</p>
<h3 id="using-audio-files"><a href="#using-audio-files">6.2.2 Using Audio Files</a></h3>
<p>You can use assets from the assets browser in your project by dragging them onto instruments, <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlists</a>, <a href="glossary.html#track">tracks</a>, and the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a>.</p>
<p>Dragging one or more assets onto an <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> or <a href="glossary.html#master-track">master track</a> creates a <a href="working-with-instruments.html#instrument-types">single instrument</a> or <a href="working-with-instruments.html#instrument-types">multi instrument</a>, depending on the number of assets selected.</p>
<p>Dragging assets onto the playlist of a <a href="glossary.html#multi-instrument">multi instrument</a> or <a href="glossary.html#scatterer-instrument">scatterer instrument</a> adds them to that playlist.</p>
<p>Dragging an asset onto the events browser creates a new event. If you drag more than one asset onto the events browser at a time, you'll be prompted to choose between creating a new event for each audio file, creating a new event containing a multi instrument, and creating a new event with one track per audio file.</p>
<h3 id="folders"><a href="#folders">6.2.3 Folders</a></h3>
<p>Folders in the assets browser represent actual folders in your FMOD Studio project's assets folder. To create a new folder, right-click on an empty space and select "New Folder". </p>
<p>You can right-click on an asset or folder and select "Move Into New Folder" from the context menu to create a new folder in that location and move the selected item into that new folder.</p>
<p>You can move any item in the assets browser into a new folder by dragging it onto that folder.</p>
<h3 id="unimported-files"><a href="#unimported-files">6.2.4 Unimported Files</a></h3>
<p>Audio files that were copied into the project's assets folder using a file manager application are automatically tagged by FMOD Studio as "#unimported", and are marked with a yellow "New!" icon in the assets browser.</p>
<p><img alt="An Unimported Asset" src="images/unimportedAsset.png" /></p>
<p>Unimported files are not included in your project's metadata, cannot be assigned custom encoding settings, and are ignored by FMOD Studio's integrated source control solutions.</p>
<p>Dragging an unimported audio file onto an audio track, an instrument, a playlist, or the events browser automatically imports it. You can also import an unimported file by right-clicking on it and selecting "Import" from the context menu.</p>
<h3 id="filename-clashes"><a href="#filename-clashes">6.2.5 Filename Clashes</a></h3>
<p>If you attempt to move or import a file into the same location as a different file with the same name, you will be prompted to replace or rename the file.</p>
<p><img alt="filenameClash" src="images/filenameClash.png" /></p>
<p>Choosing to replace the file overwrites the file already in that location with the file being imported or moved.</p>
<p>Choosing to rename the file automatically appends a number to the name of the file being imported or moved. For example, a file named <code>A.wav</code> will be renamed <code>A (2).wav</code>.</p>
<p>You may also choose to cancel the operation. If you do, the file will not be imported, moved, or changed.</p>
<h3 id="open-in-an-external-sample-editor"><a href="#open-in-an-external-sample-editor">6.2.6 Open in an External Sample Editor</a></h3>
<p>You can use an audio file editing application to edit any audio file in the assets browser. To do this, right-click on the audio file in the assets browser and select "Open in External Sample Editor" from the context menu.</p>
<p>This opens the audio file using the external sample editor specified in the assets tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preferences-dialog">preferences dialog</span class="dead-link">. If no external sample editor is specified, the file is opened using the application associated with that file type in your operating system.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>Editing an audio file in an external application alters the file on disk in your project's assets folder, and is <em>not</em> undoable. </p>
</div>
<p>FMOD Studio does not automatically update all instruments that use an asset when that asset is edited. To update all instruments that use an edited asset, right-click on the asset in the assets browser and select "Refresh" from the context menu.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-assets"><a href="#searching-for-assets">6.2.7 Searching for Assets</a></h3>
<p>You are able to search through your FMOD Studio project's assets in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="loupeAssets.png" src="images/loupeAssets.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to searching for assets by name, you can search for assets that fit particular categories by clicking the loupe icon and selecting an item from the menu. Each menu item automatically fills the search bar with a specific search term and filters the browser to display only files and folders that fit specific criteria, as follows:</p>

<h2 id="compression-and-platform-encoding"><a href="#compression-and-platform-encoding">6.3 Compression and Platform Encoding</a></h2>
<p>In order for content to be used in your game, it needs to be <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#build">built</span class="dead-link"> into <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a>. As part of this process, FMOD Studio automatically compresses and encodes your project's assets.</p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a> allows you to set the encoding format to be used for each asset and asset folder in your project. These encoding settings, if specified for an asset or asset folder, are used for that asset or the assets in that folder in place of the default encoding setting specified for the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#platform">platform</span class="dead-link"> in the "Build" tab of the preferences dialog. Encoding formats are always platform-specific, and so apply only for the platform selected when the new encoding setting is set.</p>
<p>The assets browser also allows you to specify the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#loading-mode">loading modes</span class="dead-link"> of individual assets within your project.</p>
<p>For information about banks and building your project, see the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html">Getting Events into Your Game</a> chapter.</p>
<p>For information about specific encoding formats, see the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html#compression-formats-and-platform-settings">compression formats and platform settings</a> section of the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html">Getting Events into Your Game</a> chapter.</p>
<h3 id="custom-platform-encoding-settings"><a href="#custom-platform-encoding-settings">6.3.1 Custom Platform Encoding Settings</a></h3>
<p>When an <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset">asset</span class="dead-link"> or folder is selected in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>, and that asset or folder does not currently have custom encoding settings for the current platform, the words "Click to add a custom platform encoding setting" appear in blue at the bottom of the assets browser. You can click on this text to add a custom encoding setting to the selected asset or folder.</p>
<p><img alt="Click to Add a Custom Platform Encoding Setting" src="images/clickToAddACPES.png" /></p>
<p>Once custom encoding settings have been added to an asset or folder, the blue text is replaced by the Encoding Format, Quality, and Advanced Loading Mode drop-down menus. These menus can be used to change the corresponding settings of the asset or folder. You can change the encoding and loading settings for multiple assets or folders at a time by multi-selecting them before adjusting their settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Custom Platform Encoding Setting" src="images/customPlatformEncodingSetting.png" /></p>
<p>Assets and folders with custom encoding settings are labeled with those settings in the assets browser.</p>
<p><img alt="Custom encoded asset" src="images/customEncodedAssets.png" /></p>
<p>You can preview how your assets will sound when compressed by turning on <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#audition-with-compression">audition with compression mode</span class="dead-link"> before auditioning them. In this mode, assets auditioned in the asset preview are compressed and encoded for the purposes of auditioning in the asset preview only. To turn on audition with compression mode, click on the "Compress" button in the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset-preview">asset preview</span class="dead-link">. Audition with compression mode cannot be used to audition the XMA and AT9 compression formats.</p>
<h3 id="sample-rates"><a href="#sample-rates">6.3.2 Sample Rates</a></h3>
<p>The <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#sample-rate">sample rate</span class="dead-link"> of each asset can be customized to suit the needs of your game. Matching the sample rate of the platform you are building to avoids resampling at runtime, resulting in better performance. See the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=platforms.html">platform details</a> section of the FMOD Studio API documentation for more information on each platform's default sample rate.</p>
<p>High sample rates allow pitching up and down with better quality, but at the cost of larger files and slower performance. Low sample rates can have noticeable artifacts when pitched, but have smaller file sizes and faster performance.</p>
<p>The sample rates of FADPCM, PCM, Vorbis, and XMA encoded assets can be set to one of three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom (Default)</strong> - The sample rate can be set to a custom value between 4.00kHz and 48.00kHz using the sample rate number box.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Size</strong> - The sample rate is the lowest sample rate possible that does not audibly affect the frequencies of the asset.</li>
<li><strong>Preserved</strong> - The sample rate matches the sample rate of the original asset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assets with custom platform encoding settings are set to custom sample rate mode by default.</p>
<h3 id="quality"><a href="#quality">6.3.3 Quality</a></h3>
<p>The AT9, XMA, Opus, and Vorbis encoding formats offer a quality property that control the amount of compression used when building. While the quality property represents quality in percentages, the actual compression ratio of some encoders will be fixed within a certain range. For example, AT9 encoding won't have any difference in compression ratio when the quality property is set between 40% and 48%. You can see how FMOD Studio determines compression ratios below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vorbis</strong> - The quality maps linearly to FMOD Studio's quality property. It defaults to 37% as <a href="https://xiph.org/vorbis/faq/#quality">recommended by Vorbis</a> for the best balance between compression and quality.</li>
<li><strong>AT9</strong> - The bitrate (Kbps) depends on channel count and the quality property steps up every 16%. For more information see the <a href="https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.2&amp;page=fsbank-api.html">FMOD FSBank API</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Opus</strong> - Opus per-channel bitrates of 0.8 Kbps to 64 Kbps map linearly to the range 1% to 80% on FMOD Studio's quality slider, and per-channel bitrates of 67.2 Kbps to 128 Kbps map linearly to the range of 81% to 100%. Opus quality defaults to 63%, which corresponds to the bitrate of 50.4 Kbps used by default in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716">Opus reference implementation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>XMA</strong> - The quality maps linearly to the quality property.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Vorbis and XMA encoding formats allow both sample rate and quality to be set.</p>
<h3 id="loading-modes"><a href="#loading-modes">6.3.4 Loading Modes</a></h3>
<p>There are several different ways in which an asset can be loaded into memory for use in your game. Each loading mode has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Assets with <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#compressed-loading-mode">compressed loading mode</span class="dead-link"> are loaded into memory in compressed format when loaded, and then decompressed when played. This requires less memory than decompressed loading mode, but requires slightly more CPU when playing assets.</p>
<p>Assets with <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#decompressed-loading-mode">decompressed loading mode</span class="dead-link"> are completely decompressed into memory when loaded. This uses more memory than streaming loading mode and compressed loading mode, but requires very little CPU when playing assets. This loading mode is most commonly used for short assets that are played frequently and for mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Assets with <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#streaming-loading-mode">streaming loading mode</span class="dead-link"> are continuously loaded piecemeal from disk into a small memory buffer while playing. This substantially reduces the memory required to load and play assets. However, most platforms can only support a single-digit number of simultaneously playing streams, as streaming assets require constant disk access while playing. Streaming loading mode is most commonly used for music and background ambiences.</p>
<p>By default, assets ten seconds or longer are automatically set to use streaming loading mode. Other assets default to compressed loading mode. You can change this behavior in the assets tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preferences-dialog">preferences dialog</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p><img alt="Automatically Stream Imported Assets Checkbox" src="images/automaticallyStreamAssetsCheckbox.png" /></p>
<p>You can change the loading mode of an asset with custom platform encoding settings by using the advanced loading mode drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img alt="Streaming Settings on Assets" src="images/streamingAssets.png" /></p>
<p>You can change the loading mode of an asset that does not have custom platform encoding settings by clicking on the "Stream" button. This toggles between decompressed and streaming loading modes.</p>
<p>Because streaming assets are loaded as they play and must be buffered before they can begin playback, an instrument that plays a streaming asset may exhibit latency when triggered. It is therefore best to use non-streaming assets in instruments that require low latency.</p>
<h2 id="consolidating-assets"><a href="#consolidating-assets">6.4 Consolidating Assets</a></h2>
<p>It's occasionally necessary to replace one <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> in your project with a different audio file, or with a newer version of the same audio file. When doing this, it is not necessary to manually edit every <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> in which the old file was used. Instead, you can use the assets browser to consolidate the new and old files.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>Consolidating assets is not undoable, and deletes the replaced assets from your project's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#assets-folder">assets folder</span class="dead-link"> on disk.</p>
</div>
<p>To consolidate some files, you must first multi-select the audio files to be consolidated in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>. To multi-select audio files, hold down the Shift or Ctrl key when clicking on the files you want to add to the multi-selection. Make sure the selection includes both the audio file(s) you want to replace and the audio file you want to replace them with. Then, right-click on the file you want to replace the other files with, and select "Consolidate..." from the <a href="glossary.html#context-menu">context menu</a>.</p>
<p>Consolidating assets deletes all assets in the selection other than the one on which you right-clicked. It also automatically replaces all references to the deleted assets with references to the asset on which you right-clicked.</p>
<p><img alt="Consolidating Assets" src="images/consolidatingAssets.png" /></p>
<p>For example, in the above screenshot, right-clicking on <code>ExplosionLarge.ogg</code> and selecting "Consolidate..." from the context menu would cause <code>ExplosionMedium.ogg</code> and <code>ExplosionSmall.ogg</code> to be deleted from the project, and would also update all instruments that reference <code>ExplosionMedium.ogg</code> and <code>ExplosionSmall.ogg</code> to reference <code>ExplosionLarge.ogg</code> instead.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-missing-files"><a href="#dealing-with-missing-files">6.5 Dealing with Missing Files</a></h2>
<p>FMOD Studio monitors the contents of your project's "Assets" folder for changes. Should an <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> be moved, deleted, or renamed outside of FMOD Studio, it is automatically tagged as "#missing" in the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>. Changing the path of your project's assets folder in the assets tab of the preferences dialog also results in missing files if the files are not found under the new path.</p>
<p><img alt="Missing Files" src="images/missingFile.png" /></p>
<p>When FMOD Studio tries to audition an <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> that contains a missing file, it plays no audio for that asset. If you try to audition a missing audio file in the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset-preview">asset preview</span class="dead-link">, an error message is displayed, stating that the file cannot be found. A similar error message is displayed when trying to <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#build">build</span class="dead-link"> a <a href="glossary.html#bank">bank</a> with a missing file.</p>
<p>You can <a href="#searching-for-assets">search</a> for missing audio files by searching for "#missing" in the assets browser search bar.</p>
<p>The simplest way to fix a missing file is to add a file with the same filename as the missing file to the folder where the missing file is supposed to be. After replacing the file, right-click on it in the assets browser and select "Refresh" from the <a href="glossary.html#context-menu">context menu</a> to update all instruments that use the formerly-missing asset throughout your project.</p>
<p>Another way is to consolidate the missing asset with another asset in your project. For more information about consolidating assets, see the <a href="managing-assets.html#consolidating-assets">consolidating assets</a> section of this chapter.</p>
