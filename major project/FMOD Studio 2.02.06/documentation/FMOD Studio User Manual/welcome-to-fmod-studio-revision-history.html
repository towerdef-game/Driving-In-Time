<li>Added global parameters. The playback position of a global parameter is the same in every event instance.</li>
<li>Added support for automating objects in the global mixer using global parameters.</li>
<li>Added support for automating parameters. This allows a parameter to set the value of other parameters.</li>
<li>Added labeled user parameters. Labeled parameters can be used to discretely align parameter content and automations. Labeled parameters that already contain content also gracefully allow for insertion, reordering, and removal of labels.</li>
<li>Added discrete user parameters. Discrete parameters discretely align ordinal parameter content and automations.</li>
<li>Added the option of marking a parameter as read-only. Read-only parameters cannot be set via the API. This is useful for modulated parameters that don't need to be set externally.</li>

<li>Added support for encrypting banks. This can be set in the preferences dialog.</li>
<li>Added new sample rate modes for encoding settings. It is now possible to specify a fixed sample rate, inherit the source asset's sample rate, or allow an optimal sample rate to be automatically determined.</li>
<li>The sample rate can now be explicitly set when using the Vorbis or XMA encoding formats.</li>
<li>Added an option to flag any bank as a master bank. This removes the restriction that projects have exactly one master bank.</li>
<li>Added a new build option to allow for the built bank output to mirror the folder structure of the banks browser.</li>
<li>Extended the package project feature to allow for finer control over the metadata types included. This makes it possible to export a project template for user generated content.</li>

</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed keyboard presses getting consumed by the event editor when navigating left and right through the menu bar.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>19/09/17 1.10.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 90329)</strong></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new Welcome dialog providing streamlined access to news, learning resources and recent projects.</li>
<li>Completely replaced the FMOD Studio User Manual. The new manual contains all-new content, with succinct and up-to-date descriptions of concepts and a glossary of common terms.</li>
<li>Revamped the live update system. Changes made to the project after building banks will now be synced to the game upon connecting (this can be optionally disabled from the Preferences window). The changes also greatly increase the reliability of live update.</li>
<li>Added support for syncing assets over live update. This means assets can be added to an event while connected to live update, and auditioned directly within the game, without the need to rebuild banks.</li>
<li>Added preset parameters and effects. Parameters and effects can be shared in multiple places throughout the project, greatly improving project scalability. Presets can be browsed at the project-level through the Preset Browser window.</li>
<li>Added support for viewing automations of objects within the deck. Automations can be found under the Automation and Modulation drawer. This allows automations assigned to presets to be viewed outside of the context of an event.</li>
<li>Added support for showing and hiding automation tracks from the editor view. This can be toggled via a property's context menu.</li>
<li>Added a keyboard shortcut for creating parameters within events or from the presets browser (Ctrl+P).</li>
<li>Added support for implicit parameters. Events will now expose any parameters referenced from an effect or parameter condition, without the need for a tab for each parameter.</li>
<li>Added indicator to show the playback position of parameters on the dial display.</li>
<li>Added support for per platform effects and tracks. This allows for content to be modified or optimized for a particular set of platforms. Excluded tracks will also optimize away any referenced audio content.</li>
<li>Added tabs to the Event Editor. This allows you to browse multiple events within a single Event Editor window.</li>
<li>Improved event playback behavior in the tool to match the in-game playback behavior. Events will now be allowed to end naturally. The playback state of events is now clearly labeled above the timecode.</li>
<li>Added a pause button (Shift+Spacebar shortcut key can be used to toggle the pause state). Changed the stop button to trigger a non-immediate stop on first press, and an immediate stop while in the stopping state (Spacebar shortcut key while playing).</li>
<li>Added tooltips to the transport buttons to indicate their shortcut keys.</li>
<li>Added indicators to show which buses are active in the mixer. This works within the tool and when connected to a game via live update.</li>
<li>Added support for displaying live values in the mixer. These indicators display the effective value of a given property is in the mixer, as they are after snapshots are applied. This works within the tool and when connected to a game via live update.</li>
<li>Added support for more explicit channel formats. You can now set a bus input or output to discrete surround modes. The "Surround" format has been renamed to the "Platform" format, as it matches the platform surround mode selected in the project preferences.</li>
<li>Added support for the 7.1.4 channel format.</li>
<li>Improved channel format propagation. The bus panner will no longer force discrete surround formats to match the platform surround format. Also, the master bus can have format specified independent of the platform format.</li>
<li>Support double clicking number boxes to reset their value. An edit button has been added to the left of the number box to enter text entry mode.</li>
<li>Improved screen space usage in the multitrack.</li>
<li>Added support for resizing the properties area of windows. This permits resizing of the 3D view and notes sections.</li>
<li>Added a velocity property to game parameters, allowing the playback position of the parameter to move by a fixed amount each update.</li>
<li>Added "Expose recursively via event instruments" property to game parameters. This allows events to automatically expose parameters of events that they reference via an event instrument.</li>
<li>Moved the parameter hold flags to the edit parameter dialog instead of displaying it in the deck.</li>
<li>Added the FMOD Gain effect for doing simple gain adjustments without using the Fader.</li>
<li>Added the spawn rate property to the scatterer. This allows for scaling of the spawn interval range.</li>
<li>Added support for setting the pitch of mixer groups. This will scale the pitch of events routing into this bus. Bus pitch can also be affected via snapshots now.</li>
<li>Added support for customizing the user interface of DSP plug-ins. See the user manual for further information.</li>
<li>Extended support for inspecting the object model via tool scripting API. Calling studio.project.model.document() will retrieve a summary of the object types available.</li>
<li>Added studio.system.require() to the scripting API (this replaces studio._internal.require()). This allows script modules to be referenced across files (see scripting documentation for further details).</li>
<li>Added the studio.project.Entity.findInstances() and studio.project.Entity.singletonInstance() functions to the scripting API. For example, calling studio.project.model.Event.findInstances() will retrieve all events within a project.</li>
<li>Added the project.buildStarted and project.buildEnded callbacks to the scripting API. These can be used to execute commands before and after builds.</li>
<li>Added a number of entity-specific functions to the scripting API. See the scripting API section of the manual for further details.</li>
<li>Added a "Flatten" option to folder-based browsers. This allows for items (e.g. audio files, events, etc.) to be displayed alphabetically in a non-heirarchical list view. This is useful when batch selecting the results of a search filter.</li>
<li>Added the VCA browser to the browser tabs available in the Mixer window.</li>
<li>Added a context menu option to open a bank's built output in Explorer or Finder.</li>
<li>Added a context menu option to remove fade curves from instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sequential multi and scatterer instruments now track their current playlist entry on a per-event-instance basis, rather than globally.</li>
<li>Number boxes now look correctly disabled in the playlist item display, when no entry is selected.</li>
<li>Markers with identical names are now differentiated correctly in context menus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terms throughout the interface have been corrected to match a new, more consistent naming convention. The terms "Sound" and "Module" have been replaced with "Instrument". The "Marker" object is now called "Destination Marker". Finally, properties of the scatterer instrument now refer to "spawning" rather than "sounds".</li>
<li>Some scripting API changes have been made which may affect older scripts. These include renaming studio._internal.require to studio.system.require. Getting and setting parameter cursor positions can now be done by calling the getCursorPosition() and setCursorPosition() functions on the parameter, rather than using the cursorPosition property.</li>
</ul>

<li>Improved the profiler track heads to display the full path for events and buses. The track subheading will also show the object type.</li>
<li>Added support for adding spatial effects (such as the 3D Panner) to any track in an event. Note that content authored to make use of this will only work correctly when using the 1.09.06 Studio API or up.</li>
<li>Removed restrictions preventing adding multiple spatial effects to a track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed issue whereby events that are loaded by recording through the profiler will require re-saving unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Fixed migrating from a 1.05 or older project results in incorrect output format on global buses with sends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designer migration now converts the first parameter with non zero velocity and sustain points to the timeline.</li>
<li>Studio now displays a warning when migrating a Designer project with auto pitch enabled sounds on a parameter with sustain points. This setup is currently not supported by the migration.</li>
<li>Studio now displays a warning when migrating a Designer project with event containing multiple parameters with sustain points. This setup is currently not supported by the migration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>08/06/17 1.09.05 - Studio Tool minor release (build 87666)</strong></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for fine tuning the value of an automation point by holding the control modifier key. Editing automation point values now behaves similarly to dragging the value of a dial control. The control or shift modifier keys can be used to lock the value of the automation point vertically or horizontally, respectively. The alt modifier key can be used to disable snapping while dragging multitrack items.</li>
<li>Added support for migrating FMOD Designer's Reverb Level, Reverb Balance and FMOD Flange.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>01/12/16 1.09.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 82164)</strong></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the Multiband EQ effect. This is a highly efficient effect featuring five toggleable bands that can be set to lowpass, highpass, shelf, peaking, band-pass, all-pass and notch modes.</li>
<li>Added all-new sound module playback visualization. It is now possible to clearly see the playback state of sound modules when triggered on the timeline or via a parameter. This greatly simplifies designing and debugging event playback.</li>
<li>Sound modules have been visually revamped to show loop points more clearly, as well as the zero-crossing line for waveforms. Multi sounds and scatterer sounds will now display a preview of their playlist items in their trigger regions, providing playlist information at a glance.</li>
<li>Added explicit control over synchronous (time-locked) and asynchronous playback of sound modules (which was previously dictated by the looping state). This can be accessed via the 'Async' button in the sound module deck.</li>
<li>Added support for synchronous multi sounds.</li>
<li>Added support for non-looping single sounds which play back synchronously. This is useful when trying to avoid wrap-around when applying pitch randomization.</li>
<li>Improved the event creation workflow. You can now create a new 3D or 2D event directly, or pick from a user-defined list of Default Events. Default Events can be added via the Event context menu. The new workflow applies when creating event in the browser, or creating events implicitly by dragging audio files into the events browser.</li>
<li>Improved the multi sound playlist interface. Playlists now have full support for multi-selecting items, including removing or setting the play percentage of items in batch.</li>
<li>Added support for copy and pasting sound modules to and from playlists.</li>
<li>Playlist items now display their implicit play percentages if any of their siblings have a play percentage assigned.</li>

<li>Added support for displaying the stretched waveform of synchronous sounds that have a static pitch change applied.</li>
<li>Added a total event count to Instances profiler graph, which includes instances which are not currently playing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect playback volume for sounds and playlist items whose volume property is set to a non-zero dB value.</li>

<li>Added new scripting bank building function that allows user to specify the banks and platforms to build.</li>
<li>Added support to replace an audio file by dragging and dropping from platform browser a valid audio file of the same name and extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed pops occuring at the end of very short waveforms, when auditioned through the Assets tab, with the looping option turned off. This bug does not affect playback of events.</li>

<ul>
<li>Autopitch modulator now behaves in 2 different modes. When migrating from FMOD Designer, autopitch will behave as it used to be in FMOD Designer (i.e. the modulation starts taking effect at parameter's minimum). If you are migrating from FMOD Designer, we highly recommend migrating using this version. For FMOD Studio project, the modulation will start at parameter's zero and parameter with minimum value greater than zero will have the same pitch adjustment as before. These differences will be reconciled in next major release to match FMOD Designer behavior.</li>

<li>Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.</li>
<li>To avoid confusion, Audio Bin view no longer supports XM or OXM files to be imported. XM and OXM files are played back and converted to ogg internally when building which is not really the behavior user might expect (i.e. the XM or OXM files are packaged without modification). If the previous behavior is desired, users should convert the file to one of the supported formats prior to importing.</li>

The Assets folder can be mapped to a network drive, or stored separately from the project metadata.</li>
<li>New files are automatically detected when added on disk to the Assets folder. This allow you to set up your DAW to build directly into your project's Assets folder. The assets view also supports filtering by newly detected files.</li>
<li>Added the 'Consolidate' context menu. This is available when selecting multiple audio files in the assets browser and allows you to replace old assets with new ones, or merge multiple existing assets.</li>
<li>Revamped management of encoding settings. Encoding settings can now be specified on a per platform, per folder, and per asset basis from the Assets browser. Assets can be assigned custom encoding settings directly, or can inherit settings more broadly by setting encoding settings at the folder or platform level.</li>
<li>Added support for customizing available platforms for a project including support for multiple platform configurations for the same hardware type. Adding new platforms to your project can be configured from the Preferences dialog. Build output directory, speaker format, and default encoding settings can all be set on a per platform basis.</li>
<li>Added a status bar. This includes new incators for live update connection status, a validation warnings indicator, and a loading progress bar.</li>
<li>Added active platform selector to the status bar. This allows for building to a single platform, auditioning events in their platform speaker format, and adding per platform encoding settings in the assets browser.</li>
<li>Added a 'Build All Banks...' option to the menu bar. This will build all banks across every platform. The 'Build' menu bar item will now build just the banks required for the active platform.</li>
<li>Added support for left-edge trimming. You can now drag the left edge of time-locked single sounds to trim away the head of an Asset, accurate to samples. This process is non-destructive, much the same as trimming the tail of a file.</li>
<li>Added an offset field to the 'Move To...' dialog to support left-edge trimming.</li>
<li>Added support for setting a start offset as a percentage of a module's content. This allows for setting a start offset that will scale based on the selected content, for example, scaling the offset based on the sound selected in a multi sound playlist. This allows for automation and modulation of start offset over the entire duration of the sound. This complements the newly added support for time-locked left-edge trimming.</li>
<li>Added support for splitting sound modules. This occurs at either the context menu position or at the cursor position, when executed via the menu bar item.</li>
<li>Added a command for replacing a single sound with the trimmed audio. Sounds that have been non-destructively trimmed on the timeline can be replaced with a trimmed copy of the asset, using the 'Replace Audio with Trimmed Copy' context menu item.</li>
<li>Added support for snapping automation points to neighboring points, making it easier to create vertical segments in automation curves.</li>
<li>Added the assets browser tab in event editor. The assets browser tab has been added to the Event Editor window for quick access to audio files.</li>
<li>Added support for the 'Decompressed' loading mode. At runtime, this allows for assets to be decompressed into PCM data when they are loaded, rather than being decoded as they are played. This complements the existing 'Compressed' and 'Streaming' loading modes. The 'Decompressed' loading mode can only be applied as a per platform encoding setting, under the 'Advanced Loading Mode' drop-down.</li>
<li>Added support for profiling file I/O. A new graph is available in the master track of each profiler session, indicating disk bandwidth usage for bank loading, sample loading, and asset streaming.</li>
<li>Added indicators to event instances in the lifespans view of the profiler. You can now inspect when events have been delayed due to file I/O, or when they have been restarted via code.</li>
<li>Added a new script-based source control plugin interface. Source control can easily be integrated via Javascript.</li>
<li>Added SVN integration (Beta), backing onto the new script-based source control plugin interface.</li>
<li>AT9 Band Extension is now enabled by default for supported bit-rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incremented runtime bank version, requires Studio API 1.08.00 or later.</li>
<li>Latest Studio API supports loading old bank versions from 1.03.00.</li>
<li>AT9 compression now requires AT9 library 1.7.1 (DLL version 2.8.0.5) or later. Compression in 32bit versions of Studio is no longer supported in line with Sony's removal of 32bit compression libraries.</li>
<li>As the assets browser now mirrors files on disk, operations such as renaming, moving, and deleting of audio files are no longer undoable.</li>

<p><strong>05/10/15 1.07.00 - Studio Tool major release (build 68517)</strong></p>
<p>Important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio is now a 64-bit application, providing greater memory capacity and improved performance. On Windows, separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available. On Mac, Studio is now 64-bit only.</li>
<li>All plugin libraries must be built for 64-bit architecture in order to be compatible with the 64-bit version of Studio.</li>
<li>The project file format has changed significantly. Please use the in-built migration option when opening older projects.</li>

</ul>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new scripting system, allowing users to control the interface and modify project data via a JavaScript API. Scripts can be run from the console window, assigned to menu bar items, or triggered remotely from a level editor or external application. Script files with the *.js extension will be searched for in the following directories: %appinstalldir%/Scripts, %systemuserdir%/FMOD Studio/Scripts, and %projectdir%/Scripts.</li>
<li>Added support for marquee selection and movement of multitrack items. This includes moving markers, regions, and automation points in unison.</li>

<li>Added an option to filter by referenced events, within the event browser.</li>
<li>Added support for moving the parameter cursor with the left and right keys. The control modifier can be held to move in finer increments.</li>
<li>Added a new Channel Mix effect. This allows you to set per channel gain adjustments, and specify an input channel grouping.  User can control gain levels for up to 32 input channel signals (ie use a 32ch .wav file), and pipe the output to a range of repeating speaker format modes.  Ie an 8ch signal can be represented as 4 stereo tracks, and the gain sliders can be used to fade them in and out, for synced multi track interactive music.</li>
<li>Studio now comes with AudioGaming's AudioMotors and Two Big Ears' 3Dception as built-in trial plugins. Both have include a customized deck interface.</li>
<li>Panels within the properties pane can now be collapsed.</li>
