<h1>3. Organizing the Project</h1>
<p>The essential building blocks of an FMOD Studio project are <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a>, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset">assets</span class="dead-link">, <a href="glossary.html#bus">buses</a>, and <a href="glossary.html#bank">banks</a>. Most game projects also use <a href="glossary.html#parameter">parameters</a>, <a href="glossary.html#effect">effects</a>, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#vca">VCAs</span class="dead-link">, and <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshots</a> to create more complex behavior. You can create, manage, and organize all of these elements of your project using the browsers described in this chapter.</p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#event-editor-window">event editor window</a> is the first window that opens when FMOD Studio is run, and features the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a>, the <a href="glossary.html#banks-browser">banks browser</a>, and the <a href="#assets-browser">assets browser</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="The events browser" src="images/eventsBrowser.png" /></p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#mixer-window">mixer window</a> contains the <a href="glossary.html#routing-browser">routing browser</a>, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#vcas-browser">VCAs browser</span class="dead-link">, and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#snapshots-browser">snapshots browser</span class="dead-link">, and the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preset-browser-window">preset browser window</span class="dead-link"> contains the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#parameters-browser">parameters browser</span class="dead-link"> and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#effects-browser">effects browser</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>When a single window contains multiple browsers, it can only display one of those browsers at a time. You can change which browser is displayed by clicking on the tabs at the top of the browser.</p>
<p>In most browsers, you can hide all folders and show only the items in the current browser on a single level by clicking on the "Flatten" button. This is useful for searching for items without showing the folders that they reside in.</p>
<p>Dragging an item over a browser's tab switches to that browser.</p>
<p>Nearly any item in any browser can be assigned a color. These colors have no effect on in-game behavior, and so are a useful way to make specific items easier to notice at a glance.</p>
<h2 id="events-browser"><a href="#events-browser">3.1 Events Browser</a></h2>
<p>Events are the fundamental units of sound design in FMOD Studio, and are important because of how flexible they are. You can have a simple 2D event that loops for music, and another event that changes its output on the fly. The parameters of an event can trigger new sounds, or even alter or reroute audio signals, giving a very real and dynamic feel to your game.</p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a> displays your project's <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> and event folders. It allows you to create, assign and organize events, and is found in the <a href="glossary.html#event-editor-window">event editor window</a> and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#event-browser-window">event browser window</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>To create an event in this browser, right click on an empty space and select "New Event" from the context menu. This opens a sub-menu, in which you have the option to make a 3D action event, a 2D action event, a 3D timeline event, a 2D timeline event, or a custom <a href="glossary.html#default">default</a> event. </p>
<p>Newly created timeline events contain a timeline parameter sheet, while new action events contain an <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#action-sheet">action sheet</span class="dead-link">. Newly created 3D events have <span class="dead-link" href="effects-reference.html#spatializer">spatializer</span class="dead-link"> effects on their <a href="glossary.html#master-track">master tracks</a>, while new 2D events do not contain any effects when created.</p>
<p>The track formats of new 2D and 3D events is set to "Automatic", meaning that their output formats are automatically set based on their content and the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#platform">platform's</span class="dead-link"> channel format. For more information about track output formats, see the <a href="mixing.html#channel-formats">Channel Formats</a> section of the Mixing chapter.</p>
<p>You can make templates of events called <a href="glossary.html#default">defaults</a> and create new events with these through the "Defaults" sub-menu. Events created from default events are identical to those default events when first created.</p>
<p>To create a folder, right click on an empty space and select "New Folder" from the context menu. You can place as many folders as you need into your project and nest folders within folders. You can drag and drop both folders and events into other folders to organize your project to best suit your workflow. </p>
<p>Right click on an event and select "Move Into New Folder" to create a new folder on that hierarchical level and move the event into that newly created folder.</p>
<p>To filter which items are displayed, click on the search bar at the top of the browser and type part of the name of the item you want to see, or by click on the loupe icon and selecting an option from the loupe menu.</p>
<p>Clicking on an event displays it in the <a href="glossary.html#event-editor-window">event editor window's</a> editor and overview panes. Hold down the Shift or Ctrl key when clicking on events to select multiple events. Selecting multiple events allows you to edit or manipulate them as a group.</p>
<p>By default, selecting an event in the events browser does not automatically select it in the <a href="glossary.html#banks-browser">banks browser</a>. If you prefer your selection in either browser to be reflected in the other, you can change this behavior by checking the "Event editor window's event and bank browser tabs share selection" checkbox in the interface tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preferences-dialog">preferences dialog</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<h3 id="events-and-event-instances"><a href="#events-and-event-instances">3.1.1 Events and Event Instances</a></h3>
<p>An <a href="glossary.html#event">event</a> is an instanceable unit of sound content that can be triggered, controlled and stopped from game code. Everything that produces a sound in a game should have a corresponding event. An event defines how an audio <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset">asset</span class="dead-link"> behaves and sounds.</p>
<p>When an FMOD Studio event is called in your game's engine, this creates an instance of said event. Once created, this instance is independent of the original event and of any other instances of that event that might be playing. Once it is finished, that instance is then removed from memory.</p>
<p>This means that different instances of one event can have different local parameter values, instead of needing a different event for each and every event instance with different parameter values.</p>
<p>As an example, should your game require footstep sounds for all enemies on screen; rather than creating multiple events for each enemy, the same event can be shared across all enemies - each playing in a different 3D location and having different parameter values passed in for floor surfaces and velocity/pitch of footsteps.</p>
<h3 id="referenced-events"><a href="#referenced-events">3.1.2 Referenced Events</a></h3>
<p>An FMOD Studio event can reference other FMOD Studio events in the same project. This allows an event to create and stop instances of the other events it references. In this manner, it is possible to combine a number of different events to achieve a vast range of output results.</p>
<p><img alt="referencedEvents" src="images/referencedEvents.png" /></p>
<p>Each referenced event can be opened in a separate tab or window for ease of workflow and editing.</p>
<p>To create a referenced event, drag and drop an event from the event browser onto an audio track in the event editor window. This creates an <span class="dead-link" href="instrument-reference.html#event-instrument">event instrument</span class="dead-link">, which will play an instance of the event it references when triggered.</p>
<p>By default, built banks include any referenced events and their sample data for events assigned to that bank. To include referenced events in only the banks to which they are explicitly assigned, please see the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html#including-referenced-events-in-banks">Including Referenced Events in Banks</a> section of the <a href="getting-events-into-your-game.html">Getting Events into Your Game</a> chapter.</p>
<h3 id="nested-events"><a href="#nested-events">3.1.3 Nested Events</a></h3>
<p>A nested event can be thought of as a special <a href="#referenced-events">referenced event</a>.</p>
<p>A nested event can only be referenced by its parent event and can be referenced as many times as needed, but does not route into the project's mixer. Instead, it outputs to its parent's which route into the project's mixer.</p>
<p>To create a nested event, either right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#timeline">timeline</a> and select "Add Event Instrument" from the context menu, or right click on a <span class="dead-link" href="instrument-reference.html#multi-instrument">multi instrument's</span class="dead-link"> or <span class="dead-link" href="instrument-reference.html#scatterer-instrument">scatterer instrument's</span class="dead-link"> <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlist</a> and select "Add Event Instrument".</p>
<p>For all information on how to use referenced events, please see the the <a href="#referenced-events">referenced events</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="banks-browser"><a href="#banks-browser">3.2 Banks Browser</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#bank">bank</a> is a collection of <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> from your <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#fmod-studio-project">FMOD Studio project</span class="dead-link">, to be built into a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#bank-file">bank file</span class="dead-link"> that can be loaded and used in your game. The purpose of banks is to let you choose which content from your project is loaded at any given time, allowing you greater control over how much memory your game's audio consumes.</p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#banks-browser">banks browser</a> displays your project's banks and bank folders, as well as the events and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#audio-table">audio tables</span class="dead-link"> assigned to each bank. It allows you to create, edit and organize your project's banks, as well as to assign events to banks.</p>
<p>To create a new <a href="glossary.html#bank">bank</a>, right click in an empty space in the banks browser and select "New Bank". You can also create folders by right clicking in an empty space in the banks browser and selecting "New Folder".</p>
<p>Placing banks into folders does not affect the build process, but can be useful for organizing the banks browser. Built bank files are ouput to the directory specified in the build tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preferences-dialog">preferences dialog</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>You can filter what is displayed by clicking on the search bar at the top of the browser and typing part of the name of the bank you want to see.</p>
<p>By default, selecting an event in the banks browser does not automatically select it in the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a>. If you prefer your selection in either browser to be reflected in the other, you can change the behavior by checking the "Event editor window's event and bank browser tabs share selection" checkbox in the interface tab of the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#preferences-dialog">preferences dialog</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>For more information on banks, please see the FMOD Studio concepts section on <a href="fmod-studio-concepts.html#banks">banks</a>.</p>
<h2 id="assets-browser"><a href="#assets-browser">3.3 Assets Browser</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a> displays the audio files and folders in your project's assets directory. It allows you to audition, edit and organize your project's audio files, as well as to add those files to instruments and events.</p>
<p>To add a new <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset">asset</span class="dead-link"> to your project, drag and drop <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio files</a> into the assets browser. It is also possible to copy audio files directly into the asset folder of the project's file hierarchy. </p>
<p>You can also create folders by right clicking in an empty space in the assets browser and selecting "New Folder".</p>
<p>You can filter which assets are displayed by clicking on the search bar at the top of the browser and typing part of the name of the asset you want to see.</p>
<p>For more information on assets and the assets browser, please see the <a href="managing-assets.html#anatomy-of-the-assets-browser">managing assets</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="routing-browser"><a href="#routing-browser">3.4 Routing Browser</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#bus">bus</a> is a modular component of the <a href="glossary.html#mixer">mixer</a> that produces a submix from the signals <a href="glossary.html#routing">routed</a> into it, can be routed into other buses, and has its own <a href="glossary.html#signal-chain">signal chain</a>.</p>
<p>The routing browser displays your project's <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> and buses. It allows you to create and edit your project's buses, and to set the routing for your project's events and buses.</p>
<p>Any event that is not a nested event is automatically added to the routing browser.</p>
<p>To create a new <a href="glossary.html#group bus">group bus</a>, right click in an empty space in the banks browser and select "New Group". You can also new <a href="glossary.html#return-bus">return buses</a> by right clicking in an empty space in the banks browser and selecting "New Return".</p>
<p>Unlike most browsers, the routing browser does not include folders. Instead, buses and events may be placed inside group buses. This determines the routing of the buses and events in your project, such that each event or bus in the routing browser routes into the group bus that contains it. Any bus or event that isn't routed into a group bus is routed directly into the project's master bus.</p>
<p>You can reorganize your project's routing by dragging events and buses to new locations in the routing browser. For more information about group buses and routing, see the <a href="mixing.html#group-buses-and-routing">Group Buses and Routing</a> section of the <a href="mixing.html">Mixing</a> chapter.</p>
<p>You can filter what is displayed in the routing browser by clicking on the search bar at the top of the browser and typing part of the name of the bank you want to see.</p>
<p>In the <a href="glossary.html#mixer-window">mixer window</a>, selecting an event or bus in the routing browser automatically selects it in the <a href="glossary.html#mixing-desk">mixing desk</a>, if it is present in the mixing desk, and also displays its signal chain in the <a href="glossary.html#deck">deck</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the routing browser, see the <a href="mixing.html#routing-tab">Routing Tab</a> section of the <a href="mixing.html">Mixing</a> chapter.</p>
<h2 id="snapshots-browser"><a href="#snapshots-browser">3.5 Snapshots Browser</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshot</a> is an instanceable unit of changes to the project mix that can be <a href="glossary.html#trigger">triggered</a>, controlled, and stopped from game code in the same manner as an event. Each snapshot specifies a set of bus properties that it affects, and new values for those properties.</p>
<p>The snapshots browser displays your project's snapshots and <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#snapshot-group">snapshot groups</span class="dead-link">. It allows you to create, prioritize, and edit snapshots.</p>
<p>Unlike most browsers, the snapshots browser does not include folders. Instead, snapshots may be placed inside snapshot groups. You can create a new snapshot or snapshot group by right-clicking in the snapshots browser to open the context menu, and selecting "New Snapshot" or "New Group," respectively.</p>
<p>The order in which snapshots and snapshot groups appear in the snapshots browser determines their priority, and thus which snapshots determine a property's value when multiple snapshots that change a given property are active simultaneously. You can change the priority of a snapshots or snapshot group, or move a snapshot into or out of a snapshot group, by dragging it to a new position in the browser. For information about snapshot priority, see the <a href="mixing.html#overriding-versus-blending-snapshots">Overriding versus Blending Snapshots</a> section of the <a href="mixing.html">Mixing</a> chapter.</p>
<p>You can filter what is displayed by clicking on the search bar at the top of the browser and typing part of the name of the snapshot you want to see.</p>
<p>For more information about the snapshots browser, see the <a href="mixing.html#snapshots-tab">Snapshots Tab</a> section of the <a href="mixing.html">Mixing</a> chapter.</p>
<h2 id="scenes-browser"><a href="#scenes-browser">3.6 Scenes Browser</a></h2>
<p><a href="glossary.html#scene">Scenes</a> are virtual 3D environments used for auditioning your project's <a href="glossary.html#event">events</a> as if they were in a game environment, even when it is not possible to audition them in your game.</p>
<p><img alt="The Scenes Browser" src="images/scenes-browser.png" /></p>
<p>The scenes browser displays your project's scenes and scene folders. It allows you to create, assign and organize scenes, and is found in the sandbox window.</p>
<p>You can create a new scene by right-clicking on the scenes browser and selecting "New Scene" from the <a href="glossary.html#context-menu">context menu</a>. You can also create folders by right clicking in an empty space in the scenes browser and selecting "New Folder".</p>
<p>For more information about scenes, see the <a href="the-sandbox.html">The Sandbox</a> chapter.</p>
<h2 id="searching"><a href="#searching">3.7 Searching</a></h2>
<p>Most <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#browser">browsers</span class="dead-link"> in FMOD Studio feature a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#search-bar">search bar</span class="dead-link"> that you can use to find specific items in those browsers.</p>
<p>Typing text into the search bar causes the browser to display items whose names contain that text. Typing a hash symbol ("#") followed by the name of a <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#tag">tag</span class="dead-link"> into the events browser, routing browser, VCAs browser, or banks browser's search bar causes that browser to display events that feature that tag. This kind of search is not case-sensitive.</p>
<p>Clicking on a search bar's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#loupe-icon">loupe icon</span class="dead-link"> opens the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#loupe-menu">loupe menu</span class="dead-link">. Clicking on any item in the loupe menu adds a special search term to the search bar. All special search terms are case-sensitive, and can also be typed into the search bar manually.</p>
<p><img alt="Loupe Menu" src="images/loupeDropDownMenu.png" /></p>
<p>The loupe menu items are summarized in the table below, along with their corresponding special search terms, the browsers in which they may be found, and their effects.</p>

<p>If the menu item corresponding to a special search term does not appear in the loupe menu, that special search term is not available in that browser.</p>
<p>When searching using multiple <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>NOT</code> operators, it may sometimes be useful to surround groups of search terms in parenthesis ("()"). Surrounding a group of search terms in parenthesis indicates precedence, such that the operators inside the parenthesis must be evaluated before those outside it. As a result, this could be used to disambiguate between, for example, <code>river NOT (#boat AND #highTension)</code> and <code>(river NOT #boat) AND #highTension</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tags"><a href="#tags">3.7.1 Tags</a></h3>
<p>A tag is a search term that can be used to search for events with that tag in the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a>, <a href="glossary.html#routing-browser">routing browser</a>, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#vcas-browser">VCAs browser</span class="dead-link">, and <a href="glossary.html#banks-browser">banks browser</a>. To search for events with a particular tag, click on the browser's search bar, then type a hash symbol ("#") followed by the name of the tag.</p>
<p>To add a tag to an event, select that event in the event editor window. Then, in the overview pane, click on the I-beam icon that appears under "Tags", and type the name of the new tag.</p>
<p><img alt="Tagging an event" src="images/taggingAnEvent.png" /></p>
<p>You can also add a tag to an event by right-clicking on the event in the events browser, then selecting "Assign to Tag" from the context menu, and an appropriate tag from the submenu.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of tags that an event may have, and multiple events may have the same tag.</p>
<p>The tags browser contains tools for creating, viewing, organizing, editing, and deleting tags. To access the tags browser, select "Windows &gt; Event Browser" to open the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#event-browser-window">event browser window</span class="dead-link">, then click on the event browser window's "Tags" tab.</p>
